# FlaskLoginSystem
This is my first flask application , a login/signup system using mysql database , the application allows user to create an account , login and view his profile.
It checks if the email is already taken and redirects the user to the login page if he is already registered in the database , it also returns for the user a feedback of whether his cridentials got accepted or not.
I implemented a password reset option that sends the user an email to help him reset him password.

If you want to run the app:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python run.py
